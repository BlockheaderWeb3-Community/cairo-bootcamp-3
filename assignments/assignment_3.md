# Assignment 3
1. Create a `CounterV2` contract with the following logic:
    - increase count by 1
    - decrease count by 1
    - add validation check to ensure that 0 values cannot be added to `set_count`



2. Create a `CounterV3` contract  with the following logic:
    - all state-changing functions can only be executed by the contract deployer
    - set a restriction for `count` not to exceed 50


3. Deploy both `CounterV2` and `CounterV3` contracts and provide their corresponding following class_hash and contract addresses in a `solutions_3.md` file under the `Solutions` folder
